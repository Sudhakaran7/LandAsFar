Given an N x N grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land,
find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return the distance.
The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.
If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

Input Description:
First line contains N an integer, size of the matrix. (1<N<100)
Second line contains NxN integers in a single line for matrix.

Output Description:
Print distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return the distance. If the distance not found then print -1

Sample Input:
3
1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1

Sample Output:
2

Explanation:
The matrix is,
1  0  1
0  0  0
1  0  1
The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.
